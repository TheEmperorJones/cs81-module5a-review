Reflection on *hobbyTracker.js*

- What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?
    - I learned to recognize use cases and formatting requirements of various functions that handle data in array methods.


- What was the most confusing part?
    - I'm not confused as such, but I still don't know how I would necessarily combine various array methods to work in concert.  If anything, a minor source of confusion is fully knowing by heart the => arrow methods approach, which seems to dramatically simplify; you'd think it would stick, but it has not stuck yet.
